      \par  Touch screens are so widespread that they are ubiquitous in our lives. The touch screen 
      can be divided into three types: resistive screen, capacitive screen and wave screen. Their
      performance is introduced, For example, resistive screens are the cheapest and can be used for
      any contact. Capacitive screens must use a finger or a contact with a ground wire. Wave screens
      are the latest and most expensive type. In practical application, several technologies can be
      selected at the same time.Finally, a study of their identification, using the nail to press on
      the screen to see if the screen had a reaction and to further distinguish.
  \par Through the understanding of the touch screen, I realized that the development and classification
      of the touch screen and the physical principles involved are worthy of further exploration and
      research.
