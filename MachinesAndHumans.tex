	\par   In the article,~ we mentioned that artificial intelligence is closely related to the ability of computers to think.~With the continuous development of computers,~ the rapid calculation and reaction of computers has caused human pressure.~ For the possibility of computer thinking,~ we tend to think that humans think,~ although we often call people reckless or unthinking.~ Non-human life forms also bring many problems,~ such as animal behavior ability and thinking, ~the idea of truth is also applicable to other psychological process,~ we are forced to work to carry on the strict censorship of human minds.~ The development of artificial intelligence may affect human beings as machines perform well in many life forms.
\par I think we should develop and utilize artificial intelligence rationally,~ take its essence and discard its dregs. ~With the joint efforts of mankind,~ the development of artificial intelligence machine language is broader, ~and it also brings good news to people.
