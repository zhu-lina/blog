      \par  In this article, people first guess the factors that contribute to climate change,
      and finally scientists have studied that could be causing the fluctuations was the Monday-
      through-Friday grind.Because the workweek more people commute and more factories are in 
      operation,both contribute to the amount of particle pollution in the air.But the oceans 
      are slowly getting more acidic due to high levels of carbon dioxide.If carbon dioxide
      does not decrease, it will do great harm to deep-ocean lifeforms. Although the release 
      of carbon dioxide is stored in the deep ocean to curb global warming, it can contaminate
      the oceans. Therefore, in climate change, we should carefully consider the storage and
      treatment of carbon dioxide.
      \par By understanding climate change, I realized that we should protect the environment 
      and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The concrete practice is to plant more trees and 
      reduce the deforestation to build a harmonious home.
