            On the development of artificial intelligence
  
     According  to  this  article  Artificial  intelligence:  you  don't  know  the  joys  and  sorrows.
Artificial  intelligence  has  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  in  its  development.  On  the 
one  hand,  we  are  entering  an age  of  accelerated  development  of  artificial  and  robotic  
technology.  Digital machines  have  escaped  their  narrow  confines  and  started  to  demonstrate
broad  abilities  in  pattern  recognition,  complex  communication,  and  other domains  that  used
to  be  only  human. Weâ€™ve  recently  seen great progress  in  natural  language  processing,  machine
learning ,  computer  vision, simultaneous  localization,  mapping,  and  many  other  areas. On  the 
other hand,  complete  artificial  intelligence  can  endanger  humans. Therefore,  artificial intelligence
should  be  regulated  by  the  state  and  international community.  This  is,  of course,  only  a 
bold  guess. I  think  artificial  intelligence  needs  to  be  learnt  a  lot,  and  we  need  to
further  explore  it.
