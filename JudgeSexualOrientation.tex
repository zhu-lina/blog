	\par 	According to a new study,~ artificial intelligence can accurately predict whether people are gay or straight based on their faces,~ suggesting that machines identify gay people better than people. The computer algorithm can correctly distinguish the tester's sexual orientation, the following table shows the accuracy of the machine and man's homosexuality.
	 	\begin{center}
	
	\begin{tabular*}{36em}
		{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}|c|c|c|}
		\hline  
		source & Male accuracy & Female accuracy  \\ \hline 
		The machine identifies a photograph & 81\% & 74\% \\ \hline  
		The machine recognizes five photos. & 91\% & 83\% \\ \hline 
		Human identification & 61\% & 54\%  \\ \hline

\par 	Facial image hidden people cannot actually more gender perception and interpretation of information, ~sexual orientation is derived from the rise of prenatal maternal within certain hormones,~ which explains not some people are born gay.~As shown in figure 1,~researchers at Stanford university used big data algorithms to show that gay men tend to have atypical facial features, ~facial expressions and grooming styles.~ The following tableIn facial features,~ women tend to be more feminine,~ usually with a narrower chin,~ longer nose and larger foreheads than straight men.~ Female homosexuality, on the other hand, usually has a larger chin and a smaller forehead.~ Which not everyone can perceive and interpret the gender of the information,~ can now be listed algorithm easily,~ let a person not surprised by the progress of AI,~ but also has an unspeakable "fear".

	\par The development of artificial intelligence has been avoiding the minefield of moral privacy. While promoting the development of artificial intelligence,~ people are also concerned about whether artificial intelligence will surpass the wisdom of human beings. The algorithm may provide technical and research results in AI technology,~ but it is not appropriate to be a tool to judge people's sexual orientation.
