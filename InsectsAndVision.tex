	\par  Insect observation and tracking prey is being applied to improve the robot vision system,~ describes how the insects and human knowledge used in the simulation of virtual reality,~ so that the artificial intelligence can chase an object.~ Studies have shown that flying insects, such as dragonflies(Figure 1), ~have significant visual guidance.~ The dragonfly is chasing prey quite quickly,~ providing a train of thought for the improvement of the machine vision system.

\par  Mosquito bites are a common phenomenon,~ and we have taken some measures,~ such as mosquito repellent.~ But clearly this is not a perfect solution,~ because the pests have evolved three times as much vision and smell as the effects human.~ Many insects,~ including mosquitoes(Figure 2),~ are attracted by the carbon dioxide naturally exhaled by humans and other animals. ~They use vision to identify host and heat sensing information to detect body temperature. ~Researchers will be through the experiment in the female mosquitoes released into a wind tunnel of hunger,~ high concentrations of carbon dioxide injection in experimental wind tunnel in the simulation of the human respiratory signal,~ and introduces a kind of background air and plume of low concentration of carbon dioxide,~ and add 20 mosquito using camera tracking and 3d software to track their way and observation.~ Finally it is concluded that mosquitoes exposed to carbon dioxide,~ it is near a host of indicators,~ will analogy carbon dioxide intensity of surrounding objects.

\par Through the above articles,~ we can be concluded that there is an inseparable relationship between insects and vision,~ which has a positive influence on the research of machine vision.
