         According of this article---artificial intelligence: you don't know the joy and sadness,I
         think  Artificial  intelligence  has  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  in its 
         development.  On  the  one  hand, we  are  entering  an age  of  accelerated  development
         of  artificial  and  robotic  technology.  Digital machines  have  escaped  their  narrow 
         confines  and  started  to  demonstrate broad  abilities  in  pattern recognition, complex
         communication,  and  other domains  that  used  to  be  only human. We've  recently  seen
         great progress  in  natural  language  processing,  machine learning ,  computer  vision,
         simultaneous  localization  and  many  other areas. On  the  other hand, complete
         artificial  intelligence  maybe  endanger  humans.Therefore,  artificial intelligence  should 
         be  regulated  by  the  state  and  international community.  This  is,  of course,  only  
         a  bold  guess. I  think  artificial  intelligence needs  to  be  learnt  a  lot,  and  we  
         need  to  further  explore  it.
