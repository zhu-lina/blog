\par This is an article about airline security.~ In the article,~ it is mentioned that
airlines may prohibit the use of large electronic equipment, ~and airlines can handle
electronic products.~ Due to the occurrence of some terrorist incidents, ~people have
a certain fear of the use of electronic equipment in aviation.~ Therefore, ~the use of
electronic devices should be banned,~ but the income of flights has been greatly affected.
~It is suggested that the use of electronic devices in aviation should be replaced by
reading books,~ but these strategies are clearly not needed.
\par I believe that in airline security we should control and strictly inspect contraband
to ensure people's safety.~ The security of information security should also be taken care
of, ~which is related to the security of trade secrets and countries,~ and we should attach
importance to the protection of information.
