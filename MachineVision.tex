	\par This paper mainly introduces the characteristics, ~advantages and classification of machine vision,~ 
	and the application of machine vision technology in printing industry,~ agriculture,~ industry, ~medicine 
	and so on. ~In the process of automation,~ the machine vision system is widely used in the field of state
	 monitoring,~ product testing and quality control.~ Its features are to increase production flexibility,~
	  also can improve product quality.~ If it is not suitable for manual operation in a dangerous environment,~
	   machine vision can be used instead of artificial vision.~ The application of machine vision technology
	    includes artificial intelligence, ~computer science,~ image processing and so on.
	\par Through the study of machine vision,~ I have a deep understanding of the wide application of machine 
	vision.~ And in modern life,~ we will inevitably encounter some difficult problems,~ the high-speed operation 
	and accuracy of the computer will bring us great convenience.~ But we also need to combine our own rational
	 use of intelligence to achieve the greatest development.
